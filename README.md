## Core Features

-   **Secure User Authentication:** Full sign-up and login functionality managed by Supabase Auth.
-   **Private & Public File Storage:** Users can choose to upload files to a private space (only accessible to them) or a public space (downloadable by any user).
-   **Advanced File Management:** A clean, table-based UI to view file details like name, type, size, and upload date.
-   **Real-time Search:** Instantly filter public or private files by name.
-   **User Actions:** Securely delete owned files and download any public file.
-   **Robust Security Model:** Utilizes Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) and Storage Policies to enforce strict data access rules at the backend level, making it impossible for one user to access another's private data.
